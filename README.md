OpenDNS Top Domains List
========================

The OpenDNS Top Domains List is the top 10,000 domain names our
resolvers all over the globe are receiving queries for, sorted by
popularity.

The popularity is defined as the number of unique client IPs having
looked up a domain over a 1 hour period. Domain names that we flagged
as being used to serve or control malware are removed from the list.

OpenDNS Random Sample List
==========================

The OpenDNS Random Sample List is a random sample of 10,000 domain
names.

Similar to the OpenDNS Top Domains List, domains that we flagged as
suspicious are not present in the list, that can be used as a benign
data set.
